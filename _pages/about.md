Welcome to the website for the Cambridge Logic and Algorithms group. We meet weekly to read and discuss papers or books that touch upon these two themes. 

Our topic this term is the algebraic and topological theory of automata, as covered in Part III of the <a href="https://ems.press/books/standalone/172">Handbook of Automata Theory</a>. See our <a href="https://cambridgelaa.github.io/schedule/">current schedule</a> for details. 

The meetings take place in person, but it is also possible to join <b>online</b>. If you're interested in participating, get in touch with ie257 "at" cam.ac.uk.
